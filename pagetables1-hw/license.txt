MIT License - I chose to use the MIT license because the only requirement is that the MIT license is included in any redistributions of
this code, which is fine for the small nature of the project.

GPL License - I read the GPL license, but chose not to use it because its requirements are too strict for what is necessary
for this project. I specifically do not need to force people who use this code to use a GPL license.

3 Clause BSD License - I read the 3 Clause BSD License, and noticed the main difference between it and the MIT license is that 
my name may not be used to endorse any derivations of this project, and I chose not to use it because I do not believe anyone 
will use my name to endorse derivations, so the MIT will suffice and is thus preferable.
